\section{Auxiliary Power Unit (APU)}
\label{sec:apu}

A Honeywell Aerospace GTCP85-180L \gls{APU} is located in the forward part of the left wheel well. The \gls{APU} is a small, self-contained, single shaft gas turbine operating at a constant speed of approximately 42.000 \gls{RPM}. A shaft driven 40 \gls{kVA} AC generator supplies power to the electrical system. During ground operation bleed air can be used for engine starting and operation of the air-conditioning systems. Using the aircraft battery to start the \gls{APU} allows for operations on remote locations, without any ground support equipment available.

%Electrical starter, control circuits and ignition are powered through the Isolated DC bus.

\subsection{Fuel System}

The APU uses the same fuel as used for the main engines. Depending on the applied load, typical fuel consumption varies between 130 \gls{lbs/hr} and 270 \gls{lbs/hr}.

\paragraph*{Fuel Supply}
Fuel is gravity feed from the No. 2 main tank through a firewall shutoff valve installed in the No. 2 dry bay. The shutoff valve prevents fuel flow anytime the \gls{APU} control switch is placed in the STOP position, the \gls{APU} fire handle is pulled or the \gls{APU} control circuits are deengerized.

\paragraph*{Fuel Control Unit}
The fuel control unit fully automatically operates the fuel pump. Using a shaft governor the amount of fuel supplied to the combustor is varied to keep the rotational speed constant. A thermostat limits the fuel flow to protect the turbine from overtemperature, effectively also limiting acceleration during starting. While extracting bleed air, temperature limiting is shifted to the \nameref{par:bleed-air-shutoff-and-load-control-valve}.

\paragraph*{Fuel Shutoff Valve}
\label{par:fuel-shutoff-valve}
At the outlet of the fuel control unit another fuel shutoff valve opens once reaching a minimum oil pressure. During startup it opens at approximately 10\% \gls{RPM}. If oil pressure is lost the valve closes and the \gls{APU} will automatically shut down.

\subsection{Oil System}

A pressurized oil system provides lubrication to gears and shaft bearings. The shaft driven oil pump delivers oil from an external reservoir to the gears and bearings. A relieve valve maintains an operating pressure within 90$\pm$10 \gls{psi} while the \gls{APU} operates at 100\% \gls{RPM}. Oil temperature is regulated by either directing oil flow through the oil cooler, or if oil temperature is below 27°C, through the oil cooler by-pass valve.

\paragraph*{Oil-pressure sequencing switch}
At approximately 15\% \gls{RPM} oil pressure is sufficient to operate the oil-pressure sequencing switch, which completes circuits to the \nameref{par:fuel-shutoff-valve} and ignition system. It prevents starting without lubrication and ensures an adequate airflow for combustion before introducing fuel and initiating ignition.

\paragraph*{Door-control oil-pressure switch}
Oil pressure below 20 \gls{psi} (equals approximately 18\% \gls{RPM}) operates the door-control oil-pressure switch allowing to close the \nameref{par:air-intake-door}. This is done to prevent collapse of the air inlet duct due to build-up of negative pressure.

\indent
Placing the APU control switch in the "STOP" position or pulling the APU fire handle is required to complete the circuit for actually closing the \nameref{par:air-intake-door}.

\section{Advisory, Caution and Warning System (ACAWS)}
\label{sec:acaws}

\gls{ACAWS}

\section{Electric System}

2 batteries: Utility, Avionics 24V 42Ah at C1

\#2 generator powers essential AC bus, if \#2 lost APU powers essential AC bus (APU always powers essential AC bus if online), else \#1 takes load (same side takes/assumes load). If two engines/generators on same side shutdown/lost, symmetrical engines pick up loads.

\#1 generator: Left Hand AC bus.\\
\#2 generator powers Essential AC bus.\\
\#3 generator will power the Main AC bus.\\
\#4 generator will power the Right Hand AC bus.

Gen 1-4 and APU ACAWS Indications. When the GCU detects an out of tolerance condition, and a generator switch or EXT PWR/OFF/APU switch is in ON (generator) or APU (apu), it will open the line contactor and send a system status indication to the bus interface unit BIU. The
BIU will then generate a data word to the mission computer that a failure has occurred in one of the engine generators or the APU generator. An advisory, caution, and warning system (ACAWS) text message (GEN 1,2,3, or 4 FAIL or APU GEN FAIL) will then be displayed for the first ten
seconds in reverse color (black letters on a night vision imaging system (NVIS) yellow background) followed by flashing master caution lights.

\section{Avionics System}

The \gls{BIU}s convert various signals and serve as additional backup bus controllers (and somehow the Mission Computers?).

\section{Hydraulic System}

Utility hydraulic system: wing flaps, main landing gear, normal braking, nose wheel steering.
